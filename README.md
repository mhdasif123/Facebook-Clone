# Facebook-Clone Project
This project is a recreation of the popular social media platform, Facebook, using HTML and CSS. It aims to showcase my skills in front-end web development and design. While it doesn't have the full functionality of Facebook, it provides a simplified version with a focus on the user interface.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the web pages.<br>
CSS: Employed for styling and layout.<br>
Font Awesome: Incorporated for icons used in the interface.
